* Run PCA on the dataset. How many principal components do you need to explain half the variation? 
Done

* Can you give some interpretation of the principal components?
Done

* Look at the scree plot. How many PCs would you choose based on that?
Done

* Are the first few Principal Components good predictors of income_above_50k?
Done

* How well can you predict income_above_50k using the first 5 or 6 principal components? How about only the first 2?
Done


10 pts PCA
* analysis and interpretation of factor loadings
Should be able to do with what have completed so far.

* discussion of scree plot and/or analysis of some density plots of PCs
Can discuss scree plot, need to decipher, and interpret density plots.

* meaningful interpretation / discussion of conclusions 
Need to finalize above questions, then do formal write-up.

--------------------------------------------------------

* Can you gain any insights into the data based on k-means clustering? 

* Can you visualize and interpret some or all of your clusters?

* Using any and all techniques we have learned, build the best predictive model for income_above_50k that you can. What are your best features? What model did you use? What interpretations can you draw?

* What metric can you use to assess model performance? Why is that a good choice of metric in this case?

* What are some key insights you found through your analysis?


10 pts k-means

* discussion for choosing number of clusters
* analysis of cluster centers
* bivariate chart(s) against meaningful variables and/or analysis of density plots
* meaningful interpretation / discussion of conclusions 

-------------------------------------------
10 pts supervised learning

* feature engineering / selection, whether with PCA or otherwise
Can discuss how we created dummies, etc. Should we eliminate any columns like 'fnlwgt'?

* interpretation of variable importance, coefficients if applicable

* justification of choice of metric

* discussion of choice or tuning of hyperparameters, if any

* meaningful discussion of predictive power and conclusions from model
